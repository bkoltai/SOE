During this time, Morgan realized that he wanted more students to have the opportunity to learn about engineering and learn STEM concepts through engineering. Morgan was accepted into the Tufts Math, Science, Technology, and Engineering (MSTE) Education program in 2004 and graduated with a Ph.D. in Engineering Education in 2009. Morgan has been working at the Tufts University Center for Engineering Educational Outreach (CEEO) since 2004. At the CEEO, Morgan has written middle-school curriculum, led teacher professional development programs, co-taught a freshman engineering course,  and is currently co-editor-in-chief of LEGO Engineering.com a website dedicated to providing teachers with resources to teach using the LEGO tool set.","email":"morgan.hynes@tufts.edu","fname":"Morgan","id":99,"link":"http://www.ceeo.tufts.edu/People/morganhynes.html","lname":"Hynes","phone":"617-627-5888","photo":"http://www.ceeo.tufts.edu/images/ceeo_staff/mhynes2.jpg","recent":false,"updated_at":"2011-03-11T20:41:01Z"}}

We use an insect (the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta) as our model system because it has a brain with fewer neurons, many of which can be identified and kept alive outside the animal.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are pursuing three major projects: \r\n\r\n1. The neural control of soft-bodied locomotion where we are trying to understand how the nervous system controls complex movements. These studies have potential applications in the design and control of a new type of flexible robot using neuromechanics. \r\n\r\n2. The structure and function of neuronal acetylcholine receptors. These receptors mediate the transmission of sensory information into the brain and we are looking at the biochemical and electrical components of signaling and how different types of receptors interact. Our findings could be relevant for alleviating nicotine addiction and for understanding epilepsy. \r\n\r\n3. The range and specificity of nitric oxide (NO) signaling in the brain. Comparatively little is known about the role of this free-radical transmitter in the brain. We have identified individual NO-producing and responding neurons in the living nervous system and our goal is to establish how they communicate and what behaviors they control. This work will help to understand how groups of neurons are coordinated and how the brain is damaged by a stroke or other traumatic injury.
